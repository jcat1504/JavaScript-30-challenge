-Youtube times are nodelists. when you work with nodes and you want to use them as an array, convert to an array first by doing
something along the lines of:
    const seconds = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[data-time]')
    ^^this will convert data-time elements into array, and only data-time elements
Timecode in JS is a number representing timecount 
-modulu is calculating what is left. it is the remainder after division
