**WHAT DID I JUST LEARN?**

-- is for referencing elements in CSS. it is standard for CSS and backwards compatible
:root is ancestor of all elements(HTML, itself)
document.documentElement wil search for specific elements in DOM
in img selector, you can select each variable as default element
document.querySelectorAll will select all properties under specific element declared
You can do <div class = "controls"> for your controls rather than in a seperate doc
